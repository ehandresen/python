# Python Course Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Python repository!

## About

This repository is my personal tracker for the Python course I'm taking. Organized in completed assignments, and notes from lectures

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **assignments**: This directory contains subdirectories for each module or lesson of your Python course. Each subdirectory should include the assignments and exercises for that module.
- **notes**: You can use this directory to store any notes, summaries, or additional materials related to your course.

## Additional Resources

- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): Official Python documentation for reference.
- [Python Tutorial](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/): Official Python tutorial for beginners.
